## Problem Statement

In a school, various club events and lotteries are organized. The school wants to calculate the number of different ways participants can be selected for a particular event and prizes can be distributed for the lottery. You are tasked with writing a program that calculates the number of possible combinations.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20,000) – the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line with four integers:
  - P: The number of participants to be selected.
  - R: The number of prizes to be distributed.
  - N: The total number of available participants.
  - M: The total number of available prizes.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 20,000 — Number of test cases.
- 1 ≤ R, P ≤ 15 — Number of selected events from the total set.
- 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000 — Total number of available events and gifts.

### Output Format

For each test case, output the number of possible combinations of participants and prizes.
