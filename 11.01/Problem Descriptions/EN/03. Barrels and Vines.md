## Barrels and Vines

In a small wine village, there are N vines. One third of them produce two barrels of grapes, half produce one barrel, and the remaining vines do not yield fruit during the season. The winemakers decide to sell half of all the barrels of grapes, and if the number of barrels is odd, one barrel is used to make vinegar, resulting in two equal halves. Your task is to write a program that determines how many vines and barrels of grapes remain in the village after the sale.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number of test cases T.
- For each test case, a positive integer N is provided, which is divisible by 3 without remainder.

### Constraints

- 5 < N < 1000

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the number of vines and barrels of grapes remaining in the village after the sale.

### Sample Input 0

```
2
90
120
```

### Sample Output 0

```
142
190
```

### Explanation

For the first example:

- One third of the vines produce two barrels: 90 / 3 = 30 vines produce two barrels, which gives 30 × 2 = 60 barrels.
- Half of the vines produce one barrel: 90 / 2 = 45 vines produce one barrel, which gives 45 × 1 = 45 barrels.
- Total barrels: 60 + 45 = 105 barrels. Since the number is odd, one barrel is used for vinegar, leaving 104 barrels. Half of them (52) are sold, and 52 remain.
- After the sale, the village has: 90 vines + 52 barrels = 142.
