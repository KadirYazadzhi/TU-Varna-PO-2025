## Ritual Circle

A group of friends gathers to perform an ancient ritual in a circular formation. Each of them has their own place in the circle, but they wonder how many different ways they can arrange themselves if all rotations of the circle are considered the same arrangement.  
Write a program that calculates the number of unique arrangements of friends in a circle.

### Input Format

The first line contains the number **T**, representing the number of test cases.  
The next **T** lines each contain a single integer **N**, representing the number of friends.  

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 20,000 (number of test cases)  
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000 (number of friends)  

### Output Format

For each test case, output the number of unique circular arrangements.  

### Sample Input 0

```
3 
3 
4 
5 
```

### Sample Output 0

```
2 
6 
24 
```

For **N = 3**: All linear arrangements are **3! = 6**, but in a circle, they are **(3 - 1)! = 2**.  
For **N = 4**: All linear arrangements are **4! = 24**, but in a circle, they are **(4 - 1)! = 6**.  
For **N = 5**: All linear arrangements are **5! = 120**, but in a circle, they are **(5 - 1)! = 24**.
