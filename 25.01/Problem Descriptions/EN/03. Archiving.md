## Archiving

A company stores multiple files of different sizes. Due to limited storage space, the company needs to select the smallest files to be archived.  
Your task is to write a program that, for each test case, finds the **K** smallest files by size.  

### Input Format

The first line contains the integer **T** — the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).  

For each test case:
- The first line contains two integers **N** and **K** (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000) — the number of files and the number of files that need to be archived.  
- The next line contains **N** integers representing the sizes of the files. All numbers are in the range **[1, 10⁹]**.  

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100  
- 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000  
- The total number of numbers across all test cases will not exceed **10⁷**.  

### Output Format

For each test case, print the **K** smallest file sizes in ascending order, separated by spaces. Each result should be printed on a new line.
