## Lexicographical Team Number

In a company, there are `n` unique roles that can be assigned to teams. Each team must consist of exactly `k` roles, and some roles may be repeated. If we denote the team as `(r₁, r₂, …, rₖ)`, the condition `r₁ ≤ r₂ ≤ ⋯ ≤ rₖ` must be satisfied.  

Your task is to find the **lexicographical number** of a given team.

### Input Format

- The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`:  
  - `n` — the number of unique roles.  
  - `k` — the number of roles in the team `(1 ≤ k ≤ n + k - 1 ≤ 30)`.  
- The second line contains `k` integers `r₁, r₂, …, rₖ`, which represent the **role identifiers** in the team. They are given in non-decreasing order.

### Constraints

- `0 ≤ rᵢ ≤ n - 1`  
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n + k - 1 ≤ 30`

### Output Format

Print the **lexicographical number** of the team, where the numbering starts from `1`.

### Sample Input 0

```
3 2
1 2
```

### Sample Output 0

```
5
```

### Explanation 0

The combinations with repetitions for `{0,1,2}` and `k = 2` in lexicographical order:

```
0 0
0 1
0 2
1 1
1 2
2 2
```

The combination `1 2` is **fifth in order**.

### Sample Input 1

```
4 3
1 1 3
```

### Sample Output 1

```
13
```

### Explanation 1

The combinations with repetitions for `{0,1,2,3}` and `k = 3` in lexicographical order:

```
0 0 0
0 0 1
0 0 2
0 0 3
0 1 1
0 1 2
0 1 3
0 2 2
0 2 3
0 3 3
1 1 1
1 1 2
1 1 3
```

The combination `1 1 3` is **thirteenth in order**.
