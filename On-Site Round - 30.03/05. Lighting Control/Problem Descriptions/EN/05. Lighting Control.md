## Lighting Control

In an office building, there is a centralized lighting control system. Each room in the building has a lamp that can be turned on or off. The state of the lamps in all rooms is stored as a binary number, where each bit position represents the state of the lamp in the corresponding room:

- 1 means the lamp is on.
- 0 means the lamp is off.

The system administrator can issue a command to invert the state of the lamp in a given room (if it is on, it will be turned off, and vice versa). Your task is to write a program that processes multiple such commands.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number T — the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).
- For each test:
    - The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N < 2^31), which represents the initial state of the lamps.
    - The second line contains an integer Q — the number of commands to invert the lamps (1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000).
    - The next Q lines each contain a single integer P (1 ≤ P ≤ 31), which indicates the position of the lamp (bit) whose value should be inverted.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N < 2^31
- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ P ≤ 31

### Output Format

For each test case, output the state of the lamps after executing all commands.

## Explanation 0

- In the first test, N=21, which in binary is 10101.
- Invert bit at position 1: 10101 → 10100 (20).
- Invert bit at position 3: 10100 → 10000 (16).
- Invert bit at position 5: 10000 → 00000 (0).
- The result is 0.
- In the second test, N=15, which in binary is 1111.
- Invert bit at position 4: 1111 → 0111 (7).
- Invert bit at position 2: 0111 → 0101 (5).
- The result is 5.
