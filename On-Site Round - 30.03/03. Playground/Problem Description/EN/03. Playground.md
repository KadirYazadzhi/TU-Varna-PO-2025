# Playground

In a city, children love to gather at a large playground. Once a year, all the children organize an event where they must arrange themselves in a circle. Each child is unique, and the arrangement is important because they will take a photo for memory. Your task is to calculate how many different ways the children can be arranged.

## Input Format

The first line of the standard input contains the number **T**, where **0 < T ≤ 20,000**.  
This is followed by **T** test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer **N** (**1 ≤ N ≤ 1000**), representing the number of children.

## Constraints

- Number of test cases (**T**):  
  **0 < T ≤ 20,000**  
- Number of children (**N**):  
  **1 ≤ N ≤ 1000**  

## Output Format

For each test case, output the number of all possible circular arrangements of the children.

## Sample Input 0

```
2  
5  
6  
```

## Sample Output 0

```
24  
120  
```

## Explanation

- The number of distinct circular arrangements (permutations) of **N** unique children is given by **(N - 1)!** (factorial of N-1).  
  - For **N = 5**:  
    **(5 - 1)! = 4! = 24**  
  - For **N = 6**:  
    **(6 - 1)! = 5! = 120**
