# Drone Delivery System

## Problem Description
A delivery company uses autonomous drones to transport urgent packages in a city with tall buildings. The city is represented as a grid of zones with different air conditions (e.g., wind, turbulence) that affect the drone's energy consumption. 

The drone:
- Starts from any zone in the bottom row
- Must reach any zone in the top row
- Can only move: 
  - Up
  - Up-right
  - Up-left

The goal is to find the minimal energy cost for the drone to reach the top row.

## Input Format
- First line: Two integers:
  - N - number of rows (floors) in the city (4 ≤ N ≤ 1000)
  - M - number of zones (columns) in the city (4 ≤ M ≤ 1000)
- Next N lines: Each contains M integers E[i][j] representing energy cost to pass through each zone (1 ≤ E[i][j] ≤ 10⁶)

## Constraints
- 4 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ E[i][j] ≤ 10⁶
- Drone can only move up, up-right, or up-left
- Optimal solution should work in O(N×M) time complexity
- Memory can be optimized to O(M) using DP optimization

## Output Format
A single integer - the minimal energy cost to reach any zone in the top row from any zone in the bottom row.

## Sample Input 0
```
5 5
3 2 1 4 5
6 5 3 2 3
7 6 4 3 2
8 7 5 4 3
9 8 7 6 5
```

## Sample Output 0
```
13
```

## Explanation
The minimal energy path is:
- Start at zone with cost 1 (row 1, column 3)
- Move up to 2 (row 2, column 3)
- Move up-right to 2 (row 3, column 4)
- Move up-right to 3 (row 4, column 5)
- Move up to 5 (row 5, column 5)
Total cost: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 13

## Solution Approach
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming with the following recurrence relation:
```
dp[i][j] = E[i][j] + min(
    dp[i-1][j],          // from directly below
    dp[i-1][j-1],        // from below-left
    dp[i-1][j+1]         // from below-right
)
```
The solution requires O(N×M) time complexity and can be optimized to O(M) space complexity.
