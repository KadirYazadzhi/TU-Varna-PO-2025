# CHARITY

In a charity initiative, gift sets containing food and drinks are being prepared. Each set must contain exactly **H** different types of food and **D** different types of drinks. There are **N** types of food and **M** types of drinks available. Your task is to calculate how many different gift sets can be prepared.

## Input Format

The first line contains the number **T** — the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 200).  
For each test case: On a single line, four integers **H**, **D**, **N**, **M** are given, where:  
- **H** is the number of food items each set must contain (1 ≤ H ≤ N ≤ 1000).  
- **D** is the number of drink items each set must contain (1 ≤ D ≤ M ≤ 1000).  

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ H ≤ N ≤ 1000  
- 1 ≤ D ≤ M ≤ 1000  
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 200  

## Output Format

For each test case, output a single number — the count of different gift sets possible.  

## Sample Input 0

```
2 
3 2 5 4 
4 3 10 8 
```

## Sample Output 0

```
60 
11760
```

## Explanation 0

- **First test case:**  
  - N = 5, M = 4  
  - C(5, 3) = 10 (choosing 3 food items out of 5)  
  - C(4, 2) = 6 (choosing 2 drink items out of 4)  
  - Total number of sets is 10 * 6 = **60**  

- **Second test case:**  
  - N = 10, M = 8  
  - C(10, 4) = 210 (choosing 4 food items out of 10)  
  - C(8, 3) = 56 (choosing 3 drink items out of 8)  
  - Total number of sets is 210 * 56 = **11760**
