# Magical Potions

In a magical laboratory, there are **N** barrels containing different magical potions, arranged in a row. Each barrel contains a positive integer number of liters of magical potion.

## Problem Statement
Your goal is to drink the maximum amount of potion while following these rules:
- You cannot drink from two adjacent barrels
- You can choose any barrels as long as they are not adjacent
- You are not required to drink from the first or last barrel

## Input Format
- First line: **T** (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) - number of test cases
- For each test case:
  - First line: **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) - number of barrels
  - Second line: **N** integers M[i] (1 ≤ M[i] ≤ 10⁹) - amount of potion in each barrel

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
- 1 ≤ M[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000

## Output Format
For each test case, output one number - the maximum amount of potion that can be drunk.

## Sample Input 0
```
2
5
4 1 7 9 3
6
8 2 10 1 6 4
```

## Sample Output 0
```
14
24
```

## Explanation
- **First test**: Optimal selection - barrels 1, 3 and 5 → 4 + 7 + 3 = 14
- **Second test**: Optimal selection - barrels 1, 3 and 5 → 8 + 10 + 6 = 24

## Algorithmic Note
The problem is solved using dynamic programming with the following recurrence relation:
```
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + M[i])
```
where:
- `dp[i]` is the maximum sum up to the i-th barrel
- `M[i]` is the amount of potion in the i-th barrel
