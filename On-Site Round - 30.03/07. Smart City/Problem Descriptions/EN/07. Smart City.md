# Smart City 

## Problem Description
A smart city is developing a new pedestrian navigation system. The city is represented as an N × M grid where:
- Each intersection has coordinates (i, j)
- Streets only connect adjacent intersections (move right or down)
- Some streets are closed for repairs (marked with -1)

## Input Format
- First line: T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) - number of test cases
- For each test case:
  - Two integers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000) - grid dimensions
  - N lines of M numbers (0 or -1):
    - 0: street is open
    - -1: street is closed (blocked)

## Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000

## Output Format
For each test case, output one integer - the number of distinct routes from (1,1) to (N,M) using only open streets. Output 0 if no valid route exists.

## Explanation
- First test case: There are 2 possible routes
- Second test case: There are 3 possible routes

## Solution Approach
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming with the following recurrence relation:
```
dp[i][j] = 0, if grid[i][j] is blocked (-1)
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1], otherwise
```
with base case dp[1][1] = 1 (if starting point is open)
