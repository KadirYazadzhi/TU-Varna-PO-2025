## Emergency Centers

A city has **n** districts connected by a road network. The distances between each pair of districts are known. The city hall plans to build **4 emergency centers**, aiming to select **4 different districts** such that the sum of the distances between all pairs of these districts is minimized.

### Input Format

The first line contains the number **n** (4 ≤ n ≤ 300) – the number of districts in the city. The next **n** lines each contain **n** numbers, where **A[i][j]** (0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 10⁶) represents the distance between districts **i** and **j**. The distance from a district to itself is always **0**: **A[i][i] = 0**. Distances are symmetric: **A[i][j] = A[j][i]** for all **i** and **j**.

### Constraints

- 4 ≤ n ≤ 300 – number of districts.
- 0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 10⁶ – distances between districts.
- **A[i][i] = 0** for all **i**.
- **A[i][j] = A[j][i]** for all **i** and **j**.

### Output Format

Print a single integer – the minimum possible sum of distances between all pairs of the selected **4 districts**.

### Sample Input 0

```
5
0 2 3 4 5
2 0 1 2 3
3 1 0 2 3
4 2 2 0 1
5 3 3 1 0  
```

### Sample Output 0

```
12
```

### Explanation 0

If we choose districts **1, 2, 3,** and **4**, the minimum sum of distances between all pairs is:
**A[1][2] + A[1][3] + A[1][4] + A[2][3] + A[2][4] + A[3][4] = 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 12**

### Sample Input 1

```
4
0 1 2 3
1 0 4 5
2 4 0 6
3 5 6 0
```

### Sample Output 1

```
21
```

### Explanation 1

We select all **4 districts**, as the minimum sum of distances between them is:
**A[1][2] + A[1][3] + A[1][4] + A[2][3] + A[2][4] + A[3][4] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21**
