## Order of tasks

In a company, the execution of n different tasks is planned. For a given project, it is necessary to select k of these tasks to be executed in a strictly defined order. Each sequence of tasks represents a unique arrangement of tasks and has a specific number in the lexicographic ordering of all possible sequences. Your task is to determine the ordinal number of a given sequence of tasks in the lexicographic ordering.

### Input Format

On the first line, an integer T is given - the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000). Following are T test cases. For each test case:
The first line contains two integers n and k, where:
n is the total number of tasks (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10)
k is the number of selected tasks.
The second line contains k unique numbers representing the sequence of tasks to be executed.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the ordinal number of the arrangement in the lexicographic order, starting from 1.

### Sample Input 0

```
2
3 2
1 0
4 3
2 1 0
```

### Sample Output 0

```
3
15
```

### Explanation 0

First test: The possible arrangements of {0, 1, 2} with k = 2 in lexicographic order are:

0 1

0 2

1 0

1 2

2 0

2 1

The ordinal number of the arrangement 1 0 is 3.

Second test:

The possible arrangements of {0, 1, 2, 3} with k = 3 in lexicographic order:

1) (0, 1, 2)

2) (0, 1, 3)

3) (0, 2, 1)

4) (0, 2, 3)

5) (0, 3, 1)

6) (0, 3, 2)

7) (1, 0, 2)

8) (1, 0, 3)

9) (1, 2, 0)

10) (1, 2, 3)

11) (1, 3, 0)

12) (1, 3, 2)

13) (2, 0, 1)

14) (2, 0, 3)

15) (2, 1, 0) <-- this is the desired one

16) (2, 1, 3)

17) (2, 3, 0)

18) (2, 3, 1)

19) (3, 0, 1)

20) (3, 0, 2)

21) (3, 1, 0)

22) (3, 1, 2)

23) (3, 2, 0)

24) (3, 2, 1)

The arrangement 2 1 0 is 15.
