## Comparison of courses

In a university, course data is stored for the courses that students have enrolled in. Each student has a unique set of courses. For the purposes of academic analysis, a comparison needs to be made between the courses of two students to see:
All courses that at least one of the students has enrolled in.
The courses that both students have enrolled in.
The courses that only the first student has enrolled in.
The courses that are enrolled by one of the students but not both.

### Input Format

On the first line, an integer T is given - the number of test cases.

For each test case:
The first line contains two numbers N1 and N2 - the number of courses enrolled by the first and second student respectively.
The next line contains N1 integers - identifiers of the courses enrolled by the first student.
The following line contains N2 integers - identifiers of the courses enrolled by the second student.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N1, N2 ≤ 1000

### Output Format

For each test case, output four results on new lines:
All courses enrolled by at least one of the two students.
The courses enrolled by both students.
The courses enrolled only by the first student.
The courses enrolled by one student but not both.
