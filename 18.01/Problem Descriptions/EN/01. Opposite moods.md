## Opposite Moods of the Neighbors

In the village of Mirno, there are two neighbors whose moods are always opposite. When one is happy, the other is sad, and vice versa. Write a program that, given the moods of the two neighbors for the day, determines whether they are in opposite moods. Happiness is represented by positive numbers, and sadness by negative numbers.

### Hint:
The task should be solved using bitwise operations.

### Input Format

The program must be able to process several test cases in one execution. The number T of test cases will be given on the first line of standard input. For each test case, two integers A and B will be given on separate lines.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- -10^18 < A ≤ 10^18
- -10^18 ≤ B ≤ 10^18

### Output Format

For each test case, the program should output on a single line "Opposite" if the neighbors are in opposite moods, or "Same" if their moods are the same.

### Sample Input 0
