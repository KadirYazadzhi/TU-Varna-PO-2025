## Scientific Discoveries

A scientist records his observations of various astronomical phenomena every night since the beginning of his research. He wants to analyze these observations to identify when he observed a phenomenon more significant than the previous ones. The significance of the phenomenon is evaluated with a numerical value. For each night, the scientist wants to find the last night before the current one, where he observed a phenomenon with a lower significance.

### Input Format

The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each test case: On the first line, there is one integer N – the number of nights observed. The next line contains N integers v1, v2, ..., vn, the significance of the phenomenon for each night. The numbers are separated by a single space.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6

### Output Format

For each test case, on a new line, output N integers, where the i-th number is the largest night number before i, in which the significance of the phenomenon was less than the current night. The numbers are separated by a single space. After the last number, there should also be a space. If such a night doesn't exist, output 0.
