## State Toggle

An electronic systems designer is working on software for controlling lamps in a smart building. Each lamp is controlled by a unique signal represented as a number, where each bit position corresponds to a different parameter of the lamp, such as the lighting mode.  
The programmer wants to be able to toggle the lighting mode of a specific lamp from on to off and vice versa. The toggling should be performed by inverting the bit at a specific position in the number representing the lamp's state.

### Input Format

The first line contains the number of test cases **T**.  
For each test case: A single line containing an integer **X** and a bit index **N**, which needs to be inverted (bits are counted from 0).  

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100  
- 0 ≤ X ≤ 10⁹  
- 0 ≤ N ≤ 3  

### Output Format

For each test case, output the new number after inverting the bit at the specified position.  

### Sample Input 0


```
3 
2 1 
3 0 
5 2  
```


### Sample Output 0

```
0 
2 
1
```
