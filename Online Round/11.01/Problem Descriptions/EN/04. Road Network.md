## Road Network

The government plans to build a road network that will connect all the cities in a given region. Each pair of cities can be connected by a road, and each road has a certain construction cost. The goal is to find the optimal way to build the road network so that:

- All cities are connected.
- The total construction cost is minimized.
- No unnecessary roads are built (i.e., cycles should be avoided).

### Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases.
  
For each test case:

- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), where:
  - `n`: the number of cities.
  - `m`: the number of possible roads between cities.

- The following `m` lines each contain three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`:
  - `a` and `b` (0 ≤ a, b < n) are the cities that can be connected by a road.
  - `c` (1 ≤ c ≤ 10^6) is the cost of building the road between city `a` and city `b`.

### Constraints

- Number of test cases: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10
- Number of cities (vertices): 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4
- Number of possible roads (edges): 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
- City numbering: 0 ≤ a, b < n
- Road construction cost (weight of the edge): 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^6

### Output Format

For each test case, print:

- The first line: the minimum total cost for building the road network.
- The next `n-1` lines: the pairs of cities `a` and `b` that are connected by a road.

If it is not possible to connect all the cities, print `-1`.

### Explanation

- The cities are connected with roads as follows:
  - City 0 is connected to City 1 with a cost of 1.
  - City 0 is connected to City 2 with a cost of 2.
  - City 0 is connected to City 3 with a cost of 3.
- The total cost is 6, which is the minimum cost to connect all the cities.
