## Delivery Routing

In a large city, a delivery company faces the challenge of optimizing the routes of its couriers. Daily, a delivery plan must be created to ship packages to various addresses, aiming to minimize delivery time. The company has a central warehouse and a network of streets connecting different neighborhoods in the city. Your task is to design an efficient route from the warehouse to each address.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number of test cases `T`.
- For each test case:
    - The first line contains two integers `N` and `M`, representing the number of neighborhoods and the number of streets, respectively.
    - Followed by `M` lines, each containing three integers `U`, `V`, and `W`, describing a street from neighborhood `U` to neighborhood `V` with a travel time of `W` minutes.
    - The last line of each test case contains the integer `S`, indicating the neighborhood number where the warehouse is located.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ M ≤ 500
- 1 ≤ U, V ≤ N
- 1 ≤ W ≤ 100
- U ≠ V

### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum total time in minutes required to visit all addresses from the warehouse using an optimized route.

### Explanation 0

```
Explanation: The shortest paths from the warehouse (neighborhood 1) to each other neighborhood have a total length of 22 minutes: from neighborhood 1 to neighborhood 2 is 5 minutes, to neighborhood 3 is 7 minutes (via neighborhood 2), and to neighborhood 4 is 10 minutes directly from neighborhood 1.
