## Signalization for Condition

In a home automation system, signals for different device states are encoded using bit masks. Your task is to write a program that, given a number and an index, sets the n-th bit of the number to 1, indicating the activation of a specific state.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number of test cases T.
- For each test case: One line containing two integers: the number `X` and the index `n`, where `n` is the index of the bit to be set to 1 (counting from 0).

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ X ≤ 2^31 - 1
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 31

### Output Format

For each test case, output the result of the operation on a new line.

### Sample Input 0

```
3 
2 1 
3 2 
0 4
```

### Sample Output 0

```
2 
7 
16 
```
