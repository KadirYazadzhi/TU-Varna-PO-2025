## Code Organization

A programmer is reviewing their code, where each logical block of code is enclosed with round `()`, square `[]`, and curly `{}` brackets. It is necessary to check whether all blocks are properly closed and structured, without interleaving different types of brackets.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each test:
- A single line containing a string of the characters `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, and `}`.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- The length of the string for each test does not exceed 100,000 characters.

### Output Format

For each test, on a new line, output "Valid" if all blocks are properly formed, or "Invalid" if there are structural errors.

### Sample Input 0

```
3 
{[]()} 
{[(])} 
{[()]}{()}
```

### Sample Output 0

```
Valid 
Invalid 
Valid
```
