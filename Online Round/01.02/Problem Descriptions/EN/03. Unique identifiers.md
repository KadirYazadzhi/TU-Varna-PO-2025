## Unique identifiers

On an online platform, N users register, and each username must receive a unique numeric identifier. On the platform, there are M unique usernames (M ≤ N), and each of them must be associated with a unique number from 0 to M-1. Your task is to write a program that allows you to:
Quickly find the numeric identifier for a given username.
Quickly find the username based on a given numeric identifier.

### Input Format

On the first line, an integer T is given - the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).

For each test:
- On the first line, an integer N is given (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) - the number of usernames.
- On the next N lines, the usernames are entered.

Then:
- On the next line, an integer Q is given - the number of queries (1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5).
- The following Q lines contain either a username or a numeric identifier.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5

### Output Format

For each query, output the corresponding number or string.

### Sample Input 0

```
1
10
Alice
Bob
Alice
Charlie
Bob
Diana
Alice
Charlie
Eve
Diana
5
Alice
0
4
Charlie
3
```

### Sample Output 0

```
0
Alice
Eve
2
Diana
```

### Explanation 0

Unique usernames: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eve.
Mapping:
Alice → 0
Bob → 1
Charlie → 2
Diana → 3
Eve → 4

Processing the queries:
The username Alice corresponds to the numeric identifier 0.
The numeric identifier 0 corresponds to the username Alice.
The numeric identifier 4 corresponds to the username Eve.
The username Charlie corresponds to the numeric identifier 2.
The numeric identifier 3 corresponds to the username Diana.
