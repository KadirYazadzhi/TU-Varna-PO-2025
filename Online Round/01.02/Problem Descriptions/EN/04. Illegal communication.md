## Illegal communication

In a corporation, there exists a complex communication network among employees. This network can be represented as an undirected graph, where each vertex represents an employee, and each edge represents direct communication between two employees.
The company suspects that some employees are part of an illegal communication chain (cycle). Your task is to check if such a cycle exists and, if it does, to output one of them.

### Input Format

On the first line, two integers N and M are inputted - the number of employees and the number of direct communications. The following M lines each contain two integers u and v, which represent that employee u communicates directly with employee v.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
- 0 ≤ M ≤ 200,000
- It is guaranteed that the input data is valid.

### Output Format

If an illegal communication chain (cycle) exists, output "YES" on the first line. On the second line, output a list of the employee IDs forming the cycle, starting and ending with the same employee.

If there is no cycle, output "NO".
