## Daily Status

In a manufacturing factory, the daily status of a specific device is recorded for each day of the month. The status is stored in a number where each bit of the number indicates whether the device was in operational mode (1) or off (0) for the corresponding day of the month. Your task is to write a program that checks whether the device was on for a specific day.

### Hint:
The task should be solved using bitwise operations.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each test case:
- The first line contains a number N, which encodes the operational days of the device for the month.
- The second line contains a number D, which indicates the day of the month (1 to 31) for which you need to check if the device was on.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ N < 2^31
- 1 ≤ D ≤ 31

### Output Format

For each test case, output "Operational" if the device was on on the specified day, or "Off" if it was off.

### Sample Input 0

```
2 
21 
3 
15 
5 
```

### Sample Output 0

```
Operational 
Off 
```


### Explanation

In the first test case, the number 21 is represented in binary as 10101. This means that the device was on on days 1, 3, and 5. The query is for day 3, when the device was operational. In the second test case, the number 15 is represented in binary as 1111, meaning the device was on until day 4. The query is for day 5, when the device was off.
