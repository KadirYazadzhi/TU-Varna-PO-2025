## Researchers

A group of young explorers decided to embark on an expedition deep into the jungles of South America. Their goal is to study local plant and animal species, collect samples, and examine the climatic conditions in the region. The team consists of five members, including a botanist, a zoologist, two meteorologists, and a geographer. They will need all their skills and knowledge to survive in the jungle and successfully complete their mission. Their journey begins with a small plane that will take them to a village near the jungle border. From there, they must continue by car and then on foot. They need to cover a vast distance and overcome many challenges, but all of this will help them discover unknown worlds and unveil the secrets of the wild.

Upon arriving at the village, the young explorers meet the locals and equip themselves with the necessary gear for their journey into the jungle. Their preparation includes acquiring specialized equipment, and fortunately, local craftsmen have extensive experience in creating survival tools and instruments for jungle conditions. Once the team is ready to face the challenges of the expedition, they begin their exploration. Even though they are well-prepared, the explorers encounter numerous obstacles—uneven terrain, dense vegetation, dangerous animals, and other difficulties that slow them down and complicate their work. They must find the shortest route to the first base camp in the jungle, where they will commence their research. The young explorers have a jungle map that outlines all routes and points of interest for the expedition.

The young explorers start analyzing the jungle map to determine the shortest path to the base camp. They discuss different options and perform calculations to find the optimal solution. Ultimately, they manage to select the fastest and safest route leading to the first camp. Now, your task is to write a program to determine this shortest route.

### Input Format

The first line of the standard input will contain the number **T** of test cases. The following **T** test cases each begin with a line containing two integers **N** and **M**, representing the number of locations and the number of paths, respectively. The next **M** lines contain three integers specifying the routes: the starting location, the destination location, and the distance in kilometers. The goal is to compute the shortest distance from location **1** to location **N**.

### Constraints

- 0 < T <= 10
- 0 < N <= 100
- 0 < M <= 1000

### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer—the shortest path calculated in kilometers.
