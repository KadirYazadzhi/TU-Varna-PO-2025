## Area of a Triangle

In a construction project, **GPS devices** are used to locate key points on the terrain.  
Every set of three points forms a **triangle**, and engineers need to know its **area**.  

Your task is to write a program that **calculates the area** of a triangle defined by **three vertices** in a coordinate system.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number `T` — the number of test cases.  
- For each test case:  
  - One line contains **6 integers**: `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3`,  
    which represent the **coordinates** of the three vertices of the triangle.

### Constraints

- `1 ≤ T ≤ 1000`
- `−10^6 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^6`

### Output Format

For each test case, print the **area of the triangle** with **two decimal places** of precision.

### Sample Input 0

```
2
1 1 0 -5 5 -1
2 3 4 -2 1 6
```

### Sample Output 0

```
13.00
0.50
```

### Explanation 0

**First test:**  
- A triangle with vertices `A(1,1)`, `B(0,−5)`, `C(5,−1)` has an area of **13.00**.

**Second test:**  
- A triangle with vertices `A(2,3)`, `B(4,−2)`, `C(1,6)` has an area of **0.50**.
