## Perpendicular Distance to a Road

An engineer needs to determine the **distance** from a proposed construction site to an existing road.  
The road is represented as a **line segment** with endpoints `A` and `B` in the coordinate system, and the site is represented as a **point** `X`.  

Your task is to find the **length of the perpendicular** from point `X` to the line containing segment `AB`,  
regardless of whether the perpendicular falls **inside** or **outside** the segment.

### Input Format

- The first line contains the number `T` — the number of test cases.  
- For each test case:  
  - One line contains **6 integers**: `xA, yA, xB, yB, xX, yX`,  
    which represent the **coordinates** of points `A`, `B`, and `X`.

### Constraints

- `1 ≤ T ≤ 1000`

### Output Format

For each test case, print the **length of the perpendicular** from `X` to `AB` with **two decimal places** of precision.

### Sample Input 0

```
2
0 0 4 0 2 3
1 1 3 3 2 0
```

### Sample Output 0

```
3.00
1.41
```

### Explanation 0

**First test:**  
- The segment `AB` is a **horizontal line** from `(0,0)` to `(4,0)`, and point `X` is `(2,3)`.  
- The distance from `X` to `AB` is **3.00**.

**Second test:**  
- The segment `AB` is a **diagonal** from `(1,1)` to `(3,3)`, and point `X` is `(2,0)`.  
- The distance is **1.41**.
