## Hacker Niki

You are tasked with checking the security of your country by attempting to break an encoding scheme used by your national security agency to encrypt secret messages. You will receive a $100,000 bonus if you succeed. Although you have several keys and encrypted messages, the task seems impossible because you don’t have the decryption algorithm. By a stroke of luck, while working late at night, you find a diagram of the encoding scheme on your boss’s desk, and after some thought, you realize it has a fatal flaw and is easy to break. Here is its diagram:

You know that the standard uses a 72-bit message M (divided into three 24-bit groups M1, M2, and M3 arranged from left to right), which is encoded into a 96-bit ciphertext C (divided into four 24-bit groups C1, C2, C3, and C4) using a 72-bit key K (divided into three 24-bit groups K1, K2, and K3). The encoding uses three types of operations:
- XOR, denoted by the symbol ^;
- Addition modulo 2^24 (standard addition ignoring the carry to the 25th bit, which we don’t have anyway), denoted by the symbol +;
- Circular left bitwise shift, denoted by <.

All the listed functions are performed with 24-bit operands.

### Input Format

The first line contains the number of test cases T that you need to decrypt. The next T lines contain one test case each, consisting of an encrypted message and the key used to encrypt it. They are described by two sequences of 24 and 18 hexadecimal digits, separated by one or more spaces.

### Constraints

- 1 <= T <= 1000
- You can assume that the decrypted ASCII codes are always printable characters (ASCII codes from 0x21 to 0x7e).

### Output Format

For each line (from the second onward) in the input file, your program should print one line in the output file containing the 9 ASCII characters of the original decrypted message. One ASCII character corresponds to the 8 most significant, middle, or least significant bits of each of the groups M1, M2, and M3 in that order. For a given group, the first (leftmost) ASCII character corresponds to the most significant 8 bits, the second to the middle 8 bits, and the third to the least significant 8 bits of the group.
