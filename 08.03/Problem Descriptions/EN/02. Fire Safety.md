## Fire Safety

In an office building, the management wants to check the evacuation time in case of a fire. The building is represented as a two-dimensional grid of size n×m where each cell can be accessible (denoted by 0) or blocked (denoted by 1).

### Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. For each test case: The first line contains two integers n and m — the dimensions of the building. This is followed by n lines, each containing m integers representing the cells of the building. The last line contains two integers that specify the starting point for traversal.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50

### Output Format

For each test case, if the starting point is valid (i.e., it is not blocked and is within the boundaries of the building), output n lines with m numbers each, showing the visited cells: 1 for a cell that is visited, 0 otherwise. If the starting point is invalid, output "Invalid starting point".

### Sample Input 0

```
2
3 3
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
1 1
4 4
0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0
0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1
0 0
```

### Sample Output 0

```
Invalid starting point
1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0
```
